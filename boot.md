# Boot File - Monkey & Bot Project

Read this file at the start of each session to pick up where we left off.

## Current State
- Repo restructured: website in `/website`, brand work in `/brand`
- Brand foundations documented in `/brand/README.md`

## Next Session: Visual Identity & Messaging

### Priority 1: Visual Identity
Work on the following in order:

1. **Color Palette**
   - Consider: tech/modern vs approachable, the monkey/bot duality
   - Define primary, secondary, accent colors
   - Document in `/brand/colors.md`

2. **Typography**
   - Heading font (personality)
   - Body font (readability)
   - Document in `/brand/typography.md`

3. **Logo Direction**
   - Explore concepts: abstract, mascot-based, wordmark, icon+text
   - Consider the monkey/bot imagery
   - Document explorations in `/brand/logo.md`

### Priority 2: Messaging
1. **Tagline Options**
   - Brainstorm 5-10 options
   - Should capture: human expertise + AI scale

2. **Voice & Tone**
   - How does Monkey & Bot speak?
   - Technical but accessible? Playful? Authoritative?

### Files to Review
- `/brand/README.md` - Full brand context and story
- `/project.md` - Project structure overview

## Quick Context
- Founder: Serial tech founder, ~20 years experience, CS background
- "I am the Monkey, AI is the Bot" - human expertise scaled by AI
- Target: SMBs wanting AI automation, modern SEO, websites, apps, brand work
- Differentiator: One founder + AI = agency-level output
